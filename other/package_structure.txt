How acutilsLite works:
----------------------

acdatabase_antigens, acdatabase_sera, acdatabase_experiments

Constutors and modifiers for databases
Able to make an entry, and do smoe more advanced operations:
	Merge antigens or sera
	...



acdatabase_utils

Functions to get information from an antigen
And apply such fucntions to a list of antigens



acdatabase_titertables

Construct and operate on titertables - square and long
Long is preferred



acdatabase_titertables

Functions to do with merging titer tables



acdatabase_{x}

Helper functions - usually for _utils or _titertables
eg. acdatabase_sequences has functions operating on strings representing sequences ('KQLQKMI...') or substitutions ('F193S') etc

Pattern to use
--------------

The package is designed to make it easy to work with data across experiments. You can load all titers from all experiments in your database, then filter to get the desired subset with the id columns: ag, sr, exp

Repeat titers are indicated in the exp_repeat column

Then columns can be added by operating on the {ag/sr/exp}_records columns.
